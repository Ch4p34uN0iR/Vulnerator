### QuickStart Guide
Now that you have familiarized yourelf with the available resources (you did click the links, didn't you?), jump in to using the software!  

1. Download the software from the [Releases](https://github.com/Vulnerator/Vulnerator/releases) page
  * **Note:** Chances are, unless you are a coder or interested in seeing "under the hood", you want the compiled release (the download without the word "Source" in it)
2. Extract the entire folder from the "*.zip" file you just downloaded
3. Launch the "Vulnerator.exe" file _from within the folder you just extracted_
  * The executable has hidden files that it depends on to run - they are shipped with the application.  If Vulnerator does not find these files in the directory it is in, it will yell at you, which will make you yell at me... and I don't like being yelled at.
4. Enjoy!
